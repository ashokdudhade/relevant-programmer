I am a Software Engineering Leader focused on turning advanced AI into reliable, production-grade systems. My work centers on **Conversational AI**, **Agentic AI**, **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers**, and **Multi-Agent Systems**—designing and building the kind of intelligent applications that understand context, coordinate across agents, and deliver real business value.

I specialize in end-to-end delivery of **voice-to-voice interactions**, **intelligent chatbots**, and **AI-powered insight extraction platforms**, using **Generative AI**, **LLMs**, and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** architectures. From defining the architecture to shipping and scaling in production, I focus on solutions that are both cutting-edge and maintainable.

**Core AI Expertise**

- **Voice-to-voice and conversational systems** — Designing and implementing natural, context-aware voice and chat experiences; integrating speech recognition, NLU, and synthesis with LLMs and dialogue management for seamless human–machine interaction.
- **Multi-agent AI architectures** — Building systems where multiple AI agents collaborate, reason, and act to automate complex workflows and decision-making across domains such as customer operations, knowledge work, and process automation.
- **AI-powered insight extraction** — Creating platforms that turn unstructured and structured data into actionable intelligence using NLP, summarization, and question-answering over enterprise knowledge bases and documents.
- **Enterprise LLMs and RAG** — Implementing and scaling large language model solutions with retrieval-augmented generation: chunking, embedding, retrieval pipelines, and guardrails for safe, accurate, and cost-effective deployment at scale.

**Engineering foundation**

My AI work is built on **16+ years of software engineering experience** and **vast experience in building distributed systems**. I have designed and operated high-throughput, fault-tolerant services and data pipelines using **Java**, **Python**, **Spring Boot**, **Node.js**, **React**, and **AWS** (and related cloud services). I understand how to make AI systems not only intelligent but also observable, secure, and scalable.

I have a proven track record **leading high-performing engineering teams**—hiring, mentoring, and aligning technical direction with business goals—and delivering **scalable AI and software solutions** that drive measurable transformation.

**What drives me**

I am passionate about using state-of-the-art AI to tackle hard enterprise problems: reducing manual effort, improving decision quality, and enabling new products and experiences. I care deeply about responsible deployment, clear ROI, and continuous learning so that the systems we build today remain relevant and valuable as the technology evolves.
